<p>Manual software testing is performed by a human sitting in front of a computer carefully going through application screens, trying various usage and input combinations, comparing the actual results with the expected results and recording their observations. Manual tests are repeated often during development cycles for source code changes and other situations like multiple operating environments and hardware configurations.</p>
<p>An automated test suite can be use to playback pre-recorded and predefined actions, compare the results to the expected results and report the success or failure of these manual tests to a test engineer. Once automated tests are created they can easily be repeated and they can be extended to perform tasks impossible with manual testing. Because of this, in current software testing context people find that automated software testing is an essential component of successful development projects.</p>
<p>Currently almost all the companies are moving towards software test automation, that means they have already implemented automated testing strategies into their testing procedures or they have plans to implement. So what makes software test automation this much trendy? These are some reasons.</p>
 **1. Saves time**
<p>Software tests have to be repeated often during development cycles to ensure quality. Every time source code is modified software tests should be repeated. For each release of the software it may be tested on all supported operating systems and hardware configurations. Manually repeating these tests is costly and time consuming. Once created, automated tests can be run over and over again at no additional cost and they are much faster than manual tests. Automated software testing can reduce the time to run repetitive tests from days to hours. A time savings that translates directly into cost savings.</p>

**2. Early bug detection**
Automated tests which are scheduled to run in a pre defined frequency helps to identify bugs early.

**3. Allows to perform tests 24/7**
Automated tests can be scheduled to run overnight, so the test team can check the test report next morning and take actions accordingly.

**4. Reusability**
Once the test scripts prepared using test automation tools, they can be saved for the future requirements. So, test team can utilize this test suites as many times as required especially for automating regression testing.

**5. Distributed Test Execution**
Automated testing comes with distributed testing feature. Testers can easily execute the test scripts on more than one computer on a shared network or server simultaneously. For example: Selenium Grid.

**6. Easy & Robust Reporting**
Automation testing tools have this amazing benefit of tracking each and every test script. Each and every test script executed can be seen in visual logs. These reports can clearly show the number of test scripts already executed, scheduled, their reported bugs and how they had been fixed. Also tools like TestNG provides different types of graphical reports which allows stakeholders to analyze the test results clearly.

**7. Testing Capabilities**
When it comes to capabilities, automated testing tools can test the web applications on the various browsers available in the market via browser testing automation, example: Selenium. Also, when it comes to mobile application testing, testers can test them on various devices, example: Appium.

**8. Improves Accuracy**
Manual tests done by human can have errors, but since the automated tests
